# Asking For Help

## Open Office Hours

Instructors will be holding open office hours on each project day. Take a look at the [class calendar](https://ga-dc.github.io/wdi12/) for specific dates and times.

## Github Issues

We strongly encourage you, however, to file a Github issue prior to asking the instructors for help directly. This will not only make you a better developer but a better learner. Visit [this readme](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi12/blob/master/asking-for-help.md) for more details.
